Description: A comprehensive package for detecting and analyzing causal relationships in complex systems using pattern-based approaches. Key features include state space reconstruction, pattern identification, and causality strength evaluation. Compared to existing packages: 'vars' provides linear vector autoregression but lacks nonlinear pattern detection; 'nonlinearTseries' offers general nonlinear analysis tools but no specific causality measures; 'rEDM' focuses on empirical dynamic modeling without pattern recognition; 'tseriesChaos' implements chaos theory methods but not pattern-based causality; 'CausalImpact' implements Bayesian structural time series models; 'pcalg' focuses on graphical causal models. This package uniquely combines these approaches with novel pattern recognition techniques for robust causality detection.
