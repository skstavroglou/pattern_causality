\title{Calculate Signature Space Matrix from State Space}
\usage{
signatureSpace(M)
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{A state space matrix where each row represents a point in state space}
}
\value{
A signature space matrix where each row contains the differences between
successive elements of the corresponding state space row
}
\description{
Calculates the signature space matrix from a state space matrix by
computing differences between successive elements in each row. This transformation
helps capture the dynamic patterns in the time series data.
}
\details{
Calculate Signature Space Matrix

The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Validates input matrix dimensions
\item For each row, computes differences between successive elements
\item Returns the transformed matrix maintaining the same number of rows
}

Similar functionality can be found in the 'nonlinearTseries' package's
embedding functions, but this implementation is specifically tailored for
pattern causality analysis.
